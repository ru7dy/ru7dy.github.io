<p>Hey there, I'm Rodrigo; I am an University of <i>Valladolid</i> student of <b>Telecommunications engineering</b> degree, specialized in <b>Telematics</b> field. </p>

<p>I started <b>blogging</b> using <i>Wordpress</i> in 2007, and I closed my first blog in 2011. After that, I've been changing my blog site very often, mostly using <i>Blogger</i> and its easy integration on custom domains. However, I'm tired of <a href="urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> blogs, so I've decided to change and use <i>Jekyll</i>. </p>

<h2>Translations</h4>

<p>I started practising <b>ROM hacking</b> when I was really young, changing texts and tiles of GBC <i>Pok√©mon</i> games. I used to use tools to edit their memory and change its values. Also I did some changes just editing the game with a simple hexadecimal editor.</p>

<p>After that, my first big project was the spanish fan-made localization of <i><b>The World Ends With You</b></i>, a role-playing NDS game. Our team analyzed the game, reversed the text, offset, sounds, images... And we created tools to edit it. It had a really <a href="http://www.elotrolado.net/noticia_nueva-traduccion-completa-por-aficionados-de-un-juego-de-nds_15259">big impact</a> on the scene these days.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://tiovictor.romhackhispano.org/">IlDucci</a></i> continued this localization and he recently released a <b>new re-localization</b>, re-dubbing every character more professionaly and finishing the translation of half of the graphics we couldn't edit back in the day. For further information, have a look <a href="http://tiovictor.romhackhispano.org/the-world-ends-with-you-version-en-castellano-2-0/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Also, I've contributed to the spanish fan-made localization of <b><i>Chrono Trigger</i></b>, a remake of a <i>Square Enix</i> classic role-playing game for NDS. For further information, have a look <a href="http://www.elotrolado.net/hilo_chrono-trigger-ds-esp-parches-informacion-y-descarga_1288248">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Reversing and scripting</h4>

<p>I love <b>reversing stuff</b> and exploring how is it working. I started to get serious reversing stuff a couple of years ago, when I used to play <i><b>League of Legends</b></i>. I got into some reversing engineering forums looking for bots and I started learning how to develop my own one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I developed plenty of open source scripts for the game for <i><b><a href="http://www.botoflegends.com/forum">Bot Of Legends</a></b></i>, a well-known tool to use scripts in the game, and <i><b><a href="https://www.joduska.me/forum/">LeagueSharp</a></b></i>, a relatively new tool which supports C# instead of LUA.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, none of them are still on my GitHub: Some of them were outdated, some got lost when I changed my GitHub user half a year ago.</p>
