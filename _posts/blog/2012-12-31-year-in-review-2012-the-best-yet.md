Let me just start out by saying, 2012 has been the best year yet. I met so many extraordinary people, stumbled upon so many new and exciting opportunities, and opened up many doors for future paths. I'm ecstatic about what the future holds for me and thought it would be a good idea to record the highlights of the past year for reflection and archival purposes.

First, I should describe where I was at the beginning of 2012 (a freshman at Cal entering my second semester):

* Decent GPA, but nothing spectacular.
* The only programming language that I knew was BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks) a spinoff of the graphical language, Scratch, that was targeted towards kids and used in the introductory course CS10 at UC Berkeley.
* I had joined several clubs but was not seriously involved in anything.
* No real world job experience besides working at Wendy's in high school. (In other words, absolutely zero experience in software development).
* I vaguely knew what Python, Java, and Ruby were but had no idea what I could do with them. My crowning achievement at the time was getting selected to present my BYOB Sudoku Solver at CS Ed Day at UC Berkeley in the Fall of 2011. It managed to solve a 9x9 sudoku puzzle in around 2 minutes (super fast, I know).




At the start of 2012, I was entering in my second semester at Cal. I had done decently well in my classes my first semester, but I wanted to achieve more both inside and outside the classroom. I am a very goal-centric person and one of my biggest goals for the spring semester was to achieve high enough grades to be invited to join the EECS Honors Society, HKN (Eta Kappa Nu). To be eligible, an EECS student must attain a GPA that ranks in the top 25% of junior standing students or in the top 33% of senior standing students. At the start of the second semester, I had 57 units, 3 short of junior standing, and my GPA was a little far from what I thought the 25% cutoff was (I believe it varies between 3.62-3.65 depending on the semester). I was determined to reach this goal and several others. 

At the start of 2012, the only programming language that I knew was BYOB or Build Your Own Blocks, a spinoff of Scratch that was taught through CS10 at Berkeley. You may not have heard of either of those but in a nutshell, they are graphical languages targeted towards kids wanting to learn what programming languages are and to get a brief intro to what programming can do. 


One of my other goals was to begin gaining real-world experience (in terms of software engineering) by getting an internship, contributing to open-source software, and meeting/talking to big names in the computer science industry. 

I paid particular attention to the EECS Undergraduate announcements that every undergrad in the EECS department receives almost weekly. I began exploring some of the opportunities by reaching out to developers looking to expand their teams. In early
