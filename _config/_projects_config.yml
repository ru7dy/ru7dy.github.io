    modal: pound-pong
    description: Initially, the idea started out as a web app that would keep track of all of the Ping Pong matches that went on at the Yelp office. However, the project quickly transitioned into much more. Using an RFID scanner hooked up to an Arduino which is hooked up to the iPad, we can communicate with the application using our badges which all happen to be RFID. From there, we can 'badge' into our matches and record the winner in a seamless transaction using nothing more than our badges and a single tap to label the winner. Results are sent to a simple Flask server through a JSON API where they are stored in a Mongo Database. This was a project that I worked on with a group of 4 at our semi-annual Yelp hackathon. We had two people working on the Flask server / front-end of the website and two of us (including me) working on the iPad app and getting it to communicate with the RFID scanner.

Analyze the colors, pass the output to a solver and display the necessary steps to solve the cube. It actually worked and we won third place at a hackathon as a result. My main role was working on detecting the colors by holding up the rubik's cube to your screen.
