### 2.1 MVC - An Idea

What is MVC? MVC stands for Model, View, Controller, and it's the idea that we
want to separate our code into sections that represent different parts of our
application. Popular web applications separate into three main components.
First off, we have our models which represent the brains within our application.

Models are like objects in which they have attributes and methods that work to
edit and recall data stored within the object. Between objects, there can be
correspondances between them such as one-to-one, many-to-one, or, many-to-many
relationships. These can be thought up of as relationships between actual
objects such as a `parent` having many `children`.

Views are what show the data to the users of your web application. Once you find
a user and get all of the attributes, you show it to the user using the view.
Views are generally templated using a markup of some sort. We'll learn all about
this later on.

Controllers are the link between the two. Requests come in and they are
processed by figuring out which method is called in the controller. The
controller then links together and gets whatever data it needs processed from
the model where it is finally gathered and redisplayed in the view for the user
to interact with again.
