This problem is quite involved and also covers a lot of different topics from the course. Namely, it covers: type dispatching, coercion, iterators, generators, streams, dictionaries, and generic functions.

As a warmup, let's write simple generators, iterators, and streams. Write one of each that represents the natural numbers stream, iterator, and generator. Think about the different components of each that you need.

    def make_natural_numbers_generator():
        "***YOUR CODE HERE***"

    def make_natural_numbers_stream(first=0):
        "***YOUR CODE HERE***""

    class NaturalNumbersIterator(object):
        "***YOUR CODE HERE***"

Now we'll move onto type dispatching. If you haven't already, refresh your memory with [this note](http://markmiyashita.com/cs61a/sp13/notes/generic_functions_and_type_dispatching/).

We're going to define a generic function `add` that takes in two infinite sequences and produces a generator that represents the two sequences added together. For example, I can input the natural numbers stream and the natural numbers iterator and get back a generator where the first 5 elements are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. To do this, we will need the `type_tag` function that we generally use for type dispatching.

{% highlight python %}
def type_tag(x):
    return type_tag.tags[type(x)]

type_tag.tags = {GeneratorType: 'generator', NaturalNumbers: 'iterator', Stream: 'stream'}
{% endhighlight %}

You can find get the class `GeneratorType` by importing from `types`: `from types import GeneratorType`.

Now we want to define `add`.

    def add(seq1, seq2):
        "***YOUR CODE HERE***"

    add.impl = { "***YOUR CODE HERE***" }

Next, we need to define all of the different functions that compute the addition of the different infinite sequences that we can have. I counted 9 functions that must be created and as a hint, some can be used more than once. I created the following 6 functions. It's a good exercise to go through all of them because it will cement your knowledge of iterators, generators, and streams.

    def add_generators(gen1, gen2):
        "*** YOUR CODE HERE***"

    def add_generator_and_iterator(gen, iterator):
        "*** YOUR CODE HERE***"

    def add_generator_and_stream(gen, stream):
        "*** YOUR CODE HERE***"

    def add_iterator_and_stream(iterator, stream):
        "*** YOUR CODE HERE***"

    def add_iterators(i1, i2):
        "*** YOUR CODE HERE***"

    def add_streams(s1, s2):
        "*** YOUR CODE HERE***"

Now we are able to add two infinite sequences together. After you write this code, the following should work:

    >>> s = make_natural_numbers_stream()
    >>> g = make_natural_numbers_generator()
    >>> i = NaturalNumbersIterator()
    >>> added_s_and_g = add(s, g)
    >>> next(added_s_and_g)
    0
    >>> next(added_s_and_g)
    2
    >>> next(added_s_and_g)
    4
    >>> g2 = make_natural_numbers_generator()
    >>> added_g2_and_i = add(g2, i)
    >>> next(added_g2_and_i)
    0
    >>> next(added_g2_and_i)
    2
    >>> next(added_g2_and_i)
    4
    >>> next(added_g2_and_i)
    6
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
    def make_natural_numbers_generator():
        i = 0
        while True:
            yield i
            i += 1

    def make_natural_numbers_stream(first=0):
        def compute_rest():
            return make_natural_numbers_stream(first + 1)
        return Stream(first, compute_rest)

    class NaturalNumbersIterator(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.current = 0

        def __next__(self):
            next = self.current
            self.current += 1
            return next

        def __iter__(self):
            return self

Here are the natural numbers generator, stream, and iterator. Remember that an iterator needs both a `__next__` and an `__iter__` method and that a Stream always keeps track of _how_ to compute its rest.

    def add(seq1, seq2):
        types = (type_tag(seq1), type_tag(seq2))
        return add.impl[types](seq1, seq2)

    def add_generators(gen1, gen2):
        while True:
            yield next(gen1) + next(gen2)

    def add_generator_and_iterator(gen, iterator):
        while True:
            yield next(gen) + next(iterator)

    def add_generator_and_stream(gen, stream):
        while True:
            yield next(gen) + stream.first
            stream = stream.rest

    def add_iterator_and_stream(iterator, stream):
        while True:
            yield next(iterator) + stream.first
            stream = stream.rest

    def add_iterators(i1, i2):
        while True:
            yield next(i1) + next(i2)

    def add_streams(s1, s2):
        while True:
            yield s1.first + s2.first
            s1, s2 = s1.rest, s2.rest

    add.impl = {('generator', 'generator') : add_generators,
                ('generator', 'iterator') : add_generator_and_iterator,
                ('generator', 'stream') : add_generator_and_stream,
                ('iterator', 'stream') : add_iterator_and_stream,
                ('iterator', 'iterator') : add_iterators,
                ('stream', 'stream') : add_streams,
                ('stream', 'generator') : lambda s, g: add_generator_and_stream(g, s),
                ('iterator', 'generator') : lambda i, g: add_generator_and_iterator(g, i),
                ('stream', 'iterator') : lambda s, i: add_iterator_and_stream(i, s)
    }
