This problem uses the Tree Class defined [here.]({% code tree %})

In this problem, we want to swap the left and right branches of our tree. Take a look at the doctests and leave comments below if anything is confusing/you want a hint.

    def flip_tree(tree):
        """ Swaps the left and right branches of a tree.
        Does not create a new tree and mutates the original.

        >>> t = Tree(5, Tree(1, None, Tree(4)), Tree(7, Tree(6), Tree(8)))
        >>> flip_tree(t)
        >>> t
        Tree(5, Tree(7, Tree(8), Tree(6)), Tree(1, Tree(4), None))
        """
